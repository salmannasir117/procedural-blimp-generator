Hello, this is my Project 3 for CS 4488. 

It is a Vehicle Generator - specifically, a plane/blimp generator. I chose a blimp style aircraft as it would allow me to play with the curviness of Bezier Patches well.
To run the code, just click play. 

You will see different wings and tails that can be scaled +/- 20%, all in different colors inspired by real airlines.
I aimed for a cartoony, silly artstyle while still having everything attach properly.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy!
