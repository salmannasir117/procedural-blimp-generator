Hello, this is my Project 3 for CS 4488. 

It is a Vehicle Generator - specifically, a plane/blimp generator. I chose a blimp style aircraft as it would allow me to play with the curviness of Bezier Patches well.
To run the code, just click play. There are simple camera controls with the arrow keys, but the scene view displays the airplanes side by side well.

You can use the "resolution" variable to vary how many polygons there are per curve. For example, if the resolution is 10, there are 10 points per bezier curve, and 100 verticies in the patch. 
Resolution = 20 is a good value for visuals, 10 looks good and makes sure my computer doesn't take off. Turn it down to 2 for a fun, low poly version.

You will also see a choice for f_pattern - you can generate the planes in a line (parked), or flying in the air. When flying in the air, they are placed using "dart throwing" to make sure they do not collide. The planes are also given random rotations to make them look more dynamic in the air.

You will see different wings and tails that can be scaled +/- 20%, all in different colors inspired by real airlines.
I aimed for a cartoony, silly artstyle while still having everything attach properly.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy!
